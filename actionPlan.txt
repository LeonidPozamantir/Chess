1. Build 1-component react and backend with 1 endpoint and deploy it on AWS
    a) Create backend and frontend like in MERN
    b) Make one endpoint in back
    c) In front there should be one NavLink that navigates to Route that shows a container component that makes request to the endpoint and write it to its state
        // in typescript react-route-dom should be installed along with @types/react-route-dom
    d) Make project work in production (see end of MERN video)
    e) Check that production build works on local
    d) Make a project on AWS EC2 // to connect, it has to have internet gateway. Default VPC has it.
    e) Install git and node on AWS EC2 (pay attention: to add key to github it should be converted to OpenSSH: public from the frame, private is exported as id_rsa to .ssh)
    f) Check that the project runs on AWS // shoud be run with SUDO

2. Build authorization page
    a) Make header, navbar and content
    b) Make auth and game tabs in navbar with corresponding pages
    c) Add redux and auth reducer
    —Å1) Fake reducer, store, connect
    d) Build redux form on login page (first wo thunk, async call from the component)
    e) Make fake login backend endpoint
    f) Make sure that data is received on the back side
    g) add express-session, check that count views works https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session
    h) add passport
            https://habr.com/ru/post/201206/
            https://habr.com/ru/post/435106/
    i) add button to from that gets session content, check that session is filled, then make the button get req.user

3. Make some order in the work done - front
    a) Back to front: make AuthPage typization
    b) Add fields validation
    c) Create complex form components
    d) Show errors in the login form
    e) Move login request to thunk
    f) Show username in the header
    g) Make redirect to game if logged in
    h) Add preloader component
    i) Make endpoint "me" and getAuthUserData thunk
    j) Call getAuthUserData from app
    k) Add HOC withAuthRedirect, wrap GamePage with it and see that logged user is redirected to login page and back
            - good point to check in production
    i) Infer action types using generic types
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKrkQxFYJ1c
            https://habr.com/ru/company/alfa/blog/452620/
    i) Make app reducer and call app. Initialize from App component instead of getAuthUserData
    j) Show preloader if not logged in

4. Make order in the work done - back
    a) Move passport configuration to a separate file
    b) Work on session parameters
    c) Move secrets to config
    d) Make dbConnector and request it for users
    e) Add production.js to config

5. Login process improvement
    a) Try to set individual parameters for a session (needed for rememberMe)
    b) Implement rememberMe
    c) Implement logout

6. Begin working on the game page
    a) Build the screen styled div structure
    b) Add colored cells that react to click alerting their coord
    c) Try to put a single piece on board
    d) Take that single piece from an array and make it clickable
    d) Put all pieces for the position as a parameter, position hardcoded
    e) Break into components
    f) Improve styling
    g) Build game reducer (without actions for now)
    h) Make order in types

7. Add some dynamics to the board
    a) Trace the move made:
        - make local state for selected cells
        - handle clicks on pieces and empty cells (make alert to show the move)
        - style selected cells
    b) Make action and move the piece
        - good point to check in production

8. Rules compliance
    a) Make common script for back and front:
        https://justinklemm.com/sharing-javascript-backend-node-js-frontend-browser/
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34424845/adding-script-tag-to-react-jsx
    b) Make class Position and take all data from there

    d) Move validity check

    c) Settings page
    d) Settings enpoint
